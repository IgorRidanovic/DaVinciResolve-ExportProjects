# DaVinciResolve-ExportProjects
Export all DaVinci Resolve projects from current folder to DRP and delete projects.

This script requires DaVinci Resolve Studio V16 or above. We import the API using the canonical Blackmagic Design implementation. This is not the only OS portable way to import the API library. Read the developer documentation that ships with Resolve if unable to create a resolve instance.
